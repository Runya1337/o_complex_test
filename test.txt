Product concept
Get essential weather data, short-term and long-term forecasts and aggregated weather data is easy with our OpenWeather One Call API 3.0. This product designed to ensure easy migration from the Dark Sky API.

One Call API 3.0 contains 4 endpoints and provides access to various data:

Current weather and forecasts:
minute forecast for 1 hour
hourly forecast for 48 hours
daily forecast for 8 days
and government weather alerts
Weather data for any timestamp for 45 years historical archive and 4 days ahead forecast
Daily aggregation of weather data for 45 years archive and 1.5 years ahead forecast
Weather overview with a human-readable weather summary for today and tomorrow's forecast, utilizing OpenWeather AI technologies
One Call API 3.0 is based on the proprietary OpenWeather Model and is updated every 10 minutes. Thus, in order to receive the most accurate and up-to-date weather data, we recommend you request One Call API 3.0 every 10 minutes.
